It is criss-crossed by irregular patterns and convergent striations. There’s a central amorphous density, where these scratches seem lighter. This ‘growth’ does not look alive, although it has extended out along some lines, and there is something grasping and parasitic about it. Across the globe there are thousands of them, varying in shape and detail, but all of them grey, angular, inorganic ..."

Aspry, silver-haired gentleman, immaculately dressed and moustachioed, is coming to the end of his anniversary address as President of the Royal Society of London. Just three years after his Nobel Prize for the discovery of vitamins, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins is now a sprightly 71, his intellectual vigour undiminished. He had begun his address with a celebration of nuclear physics."

Described as a floating junkyard, the Research Vessel Lulu was the original mothership for the submersible Alvin . On 17 February 1977, Corliss was leading a three-man team sealed tightly within the Alvin two kilometres down, tracking towards the warmth of a suspected deep-ocean hydrothermal vent. The previous day, the cameras attached to a two- tonne underwater cage, towed along the seafloor by a steel cable, had taken 3,000 photographs of bare lava, ostensibly barren of life, before the film ran out."

You have a notochord: a flexible rod made of cartilage, which in your descendants, millions of generations hence, will develop into a proper backbone. For now, you flex your rod like an eel to undulate through the water, never quite fast enough. Better to stay submerged in the soft mud at the bottom, with only your head visible, while you filter out grains of food from the swell. You have a wormlike head, with a small bulging of nerves that will one day become a brain."

No cell lives the dream so wholly or so senselessly as a cancer cell, turning dream to nightmare. Nothing else captures the myopic immediacy of natural selection so starkly. The moment is all that matters for selection: there is no foresight, no balance, no slowing at the prospect of doom."

It’s a question I’ve received more than once, typically from an old man, a lifelong smoker who last took any form of exercise decades ago. Ihave no idea whether they listened to what I had to say, or turned up only to make the speaker squirm. For it’s plain that science is less good at explaining the particular than it is at statistical generalisation."

An artificial intelligence can think too, by definition, and therefore ‘is’. Yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle of anything resembling human emotions, of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearnings for oneness or oblivion, or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don’t know what emotions are: what is a feeling in physical terms? How does a discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all?"
