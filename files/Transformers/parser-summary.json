It is criss-crossed by irregular patterns and convergent striations. There’s a central amorphous density, where these scratches seem lighter. This ‘growth’ does not look alive, although it has extended out along some lines, and there is something grasping and parasitic about it. Across the globe there are thousands of them, varying in shape and detail, but all of them grey, angular, inorganic ..."

Aspry, silver-haired gentleman, immaculately dressed and moustachioed, is coming to the end of his anniversary address as President of the Royal Society of London. Just three years after his Nobel Prize for the discovery of vitamins, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins is now a sprightly 71, his intellectual vigour undiminished. He had begun his address with a celebration of nuclear physics."

Dewy grass underfoot, with patches of springy moss. Apond nearby, bursting with reeds or partially concealed beneath duckweed. Perhaps choking with algae. Or picture the savannah, yellowing in the summer haze, with occasional scrubby trees silhouetted against the shimmering heat."

      "previewText": "‘Isn’t the deep ocean supposed to be like a desert?’ Jack Corliss’s voice crackled from the depths to the acoustic telephone aboard the Lulu . Described as a floating junkyard, the Research Vessel Lulu was the original mothership for the submersible Alvin . On 17 February 1977, Corliss was leading a three-man team sealed tightly within the Alvin two kilometres down, tracking towards the warmth of a suspected deep-ocean hydrothermal vent. The previous day, the cameras attached to a two- tonne underwater cage, towed along the seafloor by a steel cable, had taken 3,000 photographs of bare lava, ostensibly barren of life, before the film ran out. But a tantalising series of thirteen pictures, corresponding to a local spike in temperature, seemed to show an improbable field of clams that appeared abruptly through a cloud of misty blue water, and then disappeared just as quickly."

      "previewText": "You are not completely spineless. You have a notochord: a flexible rod made of cartilage, which in your descendants, millions of generations hence, will develop into a proper backbone. For now, you flex your rod like an eel to undulate through the water, never quite fast enough. Better to stay submerged in the soft mud at the bottom, with only your head visible, while you filter out grains of food from the swell. You have a wormlike head, with a small bulging of nerves that will one day become a brain."

      "previewText": "‘The dream of every cell is to become two cells’ said François Jacob, the most lyrical revolutionary of molecular biology. No cell lives the dream so wholly or so senselessly as a cancer cell, turning dream to nightmare. Nothing else captures the myopic immediacy of natural selection so starkly. The moment is all that matters for selection: there is no foresight, no balance, no slowing at the prospect of doom. Just the best ploy for the moment, for me, right now, not for the many, and often mistaken."

      "previewText": "‘So how do you explain me, then?’ The question is lobbed like a hand grenade from the audience, intended to devastate the ‘expert’ standing on the stage. It’s a question I’ve received more than once, typically from an old man, a lifelong smoker who last took any form of exercise decades ago. Ihave no idea whether they listened to what I had to say, or turned up only to make the speaker squirm. For it’s plain that science is less good at explaining the particular than it is at statistical generalisation. Asimple non-answer might be ‘good genes’, but that’s little better than saying ‘fate smiled upon you’."

      "previewText": "E PILOGUE SELF ‘I think therefore I am’ said Descartes, in one of the most celebrated lines ever written. But what am I, exactly? An artificial intelligence can think too, by definition, and therefore ‘is’. Yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle of anything resembling human emotions, of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearnings for oneness or oblivion, or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don’t know what emotions are: what is a feeling in physical terms? How does a discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all?"
